===========

If you didn't know, Multiply is shutting down its social network. It's
turning into an online store. On December 1, all of your stuff on Multiply
will be gone.

So I made a Python script that can download all your photos in your old
Multiply account. The "official" way required you to use a browser 
extension that asks you to put checks on boxes and dumps all of those
images in a single folder. Also, you lose all the comments and captions 
that were on your Multiply album.

This script organizes your photos per album and generates a really ugly
album(don't complain, I'm just a programmer) that has the captions,
comments, and other things that help you remember context.

This script is useless starting December 2012.
